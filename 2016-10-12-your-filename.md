## Linked-in write-up

I have a super-power. 

I am the warp rider that can untangle the gnarliest tangles between people. I see the forest, the trees, the seeds yet to sprout, and the whole country around it. I make things make sense. 

My super-power is communication. I hit my mark everytime because instead of aiming for perfect understanding, I am feverently fighting mis-understanding instead. 

Tangebly, I can work with VP's, million-dollar account contacts, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, operators, end-users, contractors, internal or external. In the experience and training I've had, there is no situation, barring life & death, that cannot be made right through excellent communication.

I specialize in engineered products, stemming from my engineering education and shaped by the companies I've had the pleasure to work for. Tight specifications, tight schedules, and impossible problems don't scare me. Unorthodox solutions and one-off problems excite me - they're the edge-cases that matter the most. Piles of the driest data are begging to be understood by us. All people and things have something interesting waiting to be found in them and I aim to find it.
