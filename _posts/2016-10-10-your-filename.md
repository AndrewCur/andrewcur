## How To Ask Better Questions


The last person you talked to, how did the conversation go? For me, the most common interaction goes exactly like this:
> "Hi! How are you?"
"Good, and you?"
"I'm good!"

And it drops from there.

Sometimes when I talk to someone I want to get to know better, I completely land on a zero and can't think of any interesting topic. Or the weather.

I struggle to introduce topics.


When asking someone a question, what is your objective?
Elicit emotional response
Reveal your own vulnerabilites before asking for theirs
You have to build trust.

How to avoid the "interview" questions, but still get interview-level responses.

- What book have you gifted the most to people and why?
- Who do you think of when you think of success and why?
- If you could have a billboard that's anywhere and has anything on it, what would it be?

- If you won the lottery, say $100m, what would you do today?
- What's your money mantra? What's your personal financial philosophy?
- Is there a specific memory from your childhood that is related to money?
- What's your *so money* moment? When did get a big win?
- What's a financial-fail?

What are you world-class at? What makes you different? Have you replicated those results?
Whats the most life impacting purchase you've made for less than $100 in the last 6months?
What are your morning rituals? What exactly do the first 60 minutes of your day look like?
Why can't you hit your 10 year plan in 6 months?
These types of questions force you to think of the non-obvious answers.
