## How To Ask Better Questions


The last person you talked to, how did the conversation go? For me, the most common interaction goes exactly like this:
"Hi! How are you?"
"Good, and you?"
"I'm good!"
And it drops from there.

Sometimes when I talk to someone I want to get to know better, I completely land on a zero and can't think of any interesting topic. Or the weather.

I struggle to introduce topics.


When asking someone a question, what is your objective?
Elicit emotional response
Reveal your own vulnerabilites before asking for theirs
You have to build trust.

How to avoid the "interview" questions, but still get interview-level responses.

- If you could have a billboard that's anywhere and has anything on it, what would it be?
