## Fasting

Today, I am on a fast. Yes I am hungry - but I believe I have the discipline to see this through.

Honestly, a cursory look at fasting materials suggest planning such as eating certain foods, drinking a certain amount of water, and having a real purpose to your fast. Well, I may have fucked all that up since my fast is a result of curiosity and opportunity. I didn't wake up soon enough to make breakfast today, so today became the day to try it out. Let's fly on a whim!

Last night I had some pasta, shrimp, and asparagus that was generously offered by my friend Kendall before we went to a concert (Tobacco @ the Triple Rock) at around 8:30pm. We biked to the show, had a beer there, and biked home, so there was some excersize and some more calories in the beer. Before bed, and before I planned to do a fast today, I snuck in some peanut butter and milk right before bed. 

As with every morning, I did make my ritual coffee in the morning, so I have that with me today. I even added a little nutmeg as a booster. It tastes a little strange, I don't know that I'll do this too often. 

The extra nudge to fast today was not having a packed lunch either and the self-loathing that comes from paying for lunch.

This is my second wave of hunger, and I don't doubt by 4pm I'm going to be ravashed. But before then, I have a 15 minute phone interview with a possible dream job in Chicago - so today is a risky venture. To hell with comfort!

I'll come back with more.
