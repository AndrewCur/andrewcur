## It's A Perfect Duluth Day

Labor Day weekend snuck up on me! Literally it was brought to my attention on Wednesday. I suppose that means I'm long since out of college, because now, it only means I have a 3 day weekend. By virtue of my surprise, and that most people like to make big plans for this weekend, I am on my own. This is awesome. 

I made a list of all the things I could do with this wide open schedule, and most of them pointed to taking a solo trip to Duluth to do mountain biking on the famed trail system and hiking the gorgeous Jay Cooke State Park. With the truck loaded up and a plan hatched, I've made my way up to Duluth in the early Saturday morning. 

Originally I planned to spend the night in Jay Cooke, but when I arrived to book a campsite, they were full up. I'm not sure where I'm going to stay tonight, but I have a list of campsites and half the idea to camp in stealth mode within the city. For now, I'm enjoying a Witchtree ESB paired with some bacon cheese curds at Fitgers. 

Welcome to Duluth - More to follow.
