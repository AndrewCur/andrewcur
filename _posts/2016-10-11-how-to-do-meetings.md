## How to do meetings

In no particular order:

- Bring a notebook & pen
- Laptop only if necessary for a tool or presentation. No researching within the meeting. If you don't know it off the top of your head, you don't know it and that's OK.
- Note verbal ideas
- Note ideas or questions that you can't share immediately
- Show up on time
- Make it short: 30 minutes is good, 15 minutes is better 
- If it must go longer, plan breaks so people can think to themselves for a moment
- Have an objective (scope)
- Can you state that objective in 6 words or fewer?
- Have an objective set for the next meeting (schedule)
- Have relevant materials going into it, and studied
- Encourage disagreement
- Close the meeting reviewing the consensus and topics
- On a blank sheet, spend 30-90 seconds going over what was discussed
- Share the minutes with the group after the meeting
- No more than ten attendees (Google)
- Decisions not limited to meetings (Google) this both keeps you off a meeting-based schedule and helps keep decisions on merit not on popularity

### The Firing Squad

Marc Andreessen (of Netscape fame) runs his investing company by allowing any investor be able to propose and green-light individually. The caveat is they must face the firing squad of colleagues that are charged  to criticize without mercy, even if they already like it going in. If the investor still feels it's a good call, they have full autonomy to make the investment.
