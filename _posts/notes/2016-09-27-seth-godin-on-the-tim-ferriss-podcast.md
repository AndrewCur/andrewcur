## Seth Godin on the Tim Ferriss podcast

- ***Education*** as we know it in the United States was started and designed for the industrial age of manufacturing that wanted obedient, to-the-mark factory workers and other varieties of subordinates. This is on the way out. 
- The two elements most valuable in our current, post-industrial economy that are not being taught are how to *solve interesting problems* and *learn things that cannot be taught or shown*
- Ways that we can change the education of young people would be to encourage them to explore and learn only what they're interested in. A point that Seth makes is "enrollment". He clarifies the definition of enrollment to be an active, present state of contribution. **Look this up and learn.**


- ***Your brand*** is the story of you. It's implicit and ever-present as the presentation of yourself. 
- Find a message or an impression that you want to convey and let it drip into every moment of your being. **Re-listen to this segment.**
- Make the money by producing something that *someone is willing to pay you for so that you can do it again.*
- Do work that that has the *smallest* target audience. If you can't succeed here, you're really doing something wrong. It also takes away the comfort of "infinity", or in other words, you won't be able to deflect blame of your failure to scale. *"The project was too big, it was too complex. I couldn't do it myself. There was something I didn't see that prevented me from success."*
