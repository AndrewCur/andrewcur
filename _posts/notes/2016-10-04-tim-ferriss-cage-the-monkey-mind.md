## Tim Ferriss talks at the Googleplex

[Podcast link](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/07/24/how-to-cage-the-monkey-mind/)


- If you have a guaranteed market of one, yourself, you're already ahead of most entrepreneurs out there. Find things where you are the target market, things you want for yourself. Don't create things and pray there is a market.
- Tim's most significant teaching from Stoicism is conditioning for superficial shame. One example is wearing his party pants that raise eyebrows.
- I'm still not certain what the monkey brain is but he gave an example that kids doing dumb stuff is conditioning their minds to burn off those primal instincts and reactions.
- He credits the success of his podcast to his early commitment to make 6 episodes at the beginning rather than just one - because if you do just one, you will stop there.
