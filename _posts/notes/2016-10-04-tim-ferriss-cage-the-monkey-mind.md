## Tim Ferriss talks at the Googleplex

[Podcast link](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/07/24/how-to-cage-the-monkey-mind/)


- If you have a guaranteed market of one, yourself, you're already ahead of most entrepreneurs out there. Find things where you are the target market, things you want for yourself. Don't create things and pray there is a market.
- Tim's most significant teaching from Stoicism is conditioning for superficial shame. One example is wearing his party pants that raise eyebrows.
- I'm still not certain what the monkey brain is but he gave an example that kids doing dumb stuff is conditioning their minds to burn off those primal instincts and reactions.
- He credits the success of his podcast to his early commitment to make 6 episodes at the beginning rather than just one - because if you do just one, you will stop there.
- In the structure of his podcast, which was developed through experimentation of course, he shares stories and vulnerabilities of his own in the first third to encourage his guest to open up. This is something he learned from Neil Strauss, who is famously the author of The Game. I've also seen this idea cited in a few other ways to get people to open up to you. **Listen to the Neil Strauss episode**
- On his personal board of directors he selected Benjamin Franklin, and highly recommended the biography by Walter Issacson (sp?). Others were Dr. Feynman
- For longevity, he talks a bit about new age drug stuff - but also about how he fasts for 3 days every month and 7-10 days once a quarter. It sounds a bit extreme, but I think this may be doable.
- An audience member asks about doing an adult boot camp and Tim goes off on how he would punish them and make them do experiments and fasting and no caffeine etc. Sounded fun, in a masochistic way!
- A documentary about "sufferfests" [Rise of The Sufferfests](http://riseofthesufferfests.com/)
- For his non-interview podcasts he sends his guests 10 questions that are sourced from fans and a USB microphone - Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB Cardioid Dynamic USB/XLR
- Neil Gaiman's commencement speech <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAb-NYkseI&feature=youtu.be>
- Oh! And he talks about some interesting ideas around dog training, specifically that it should be sequenced and that sequence training is not really talked about - sort of like a shit judo teacher. References [Don't Shoot The Dog](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380397)
- When scheduling a meeting with someone, offer 2-3 available times for you and a suggested amount of time. Invite them to offer 2-3 times of their own if none of yours work for them. This specificity greatly reduces unecessary back-and-forth of scheduling nightmares.
