## Seth Godin on the Smart People Podcast

Show link: <http://www.smartpeoplepodcast.com/2011/08/09/episode-32-seth-godin/>

In the begining of his book *Linchpin*, he says:
"We need to stop complying with the system and draw our own map"

The system has only been around for 100 years, and the industrial economy where owning a machine creates productivity. Everyone today has far more today than anyone ever did at the beginning of the last century. There is no way we can build dramatically more efficiency or productivty. You now must break this pattern because the system has failed permanently. Mass marketing is the logical end to the end of productivity growth. It is time to find your own way to success, there is no guide anymore.
