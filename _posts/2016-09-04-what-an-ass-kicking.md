## What An Ass Kicking

I haven't been this sore since our 20 some-odd kilometer hike on Sleeping Giant outside of Thunder Bay, ON. Thank god a burger is on it's way an IPA is in arm's reach. 

Yesterday, I followed up Lester Creek Trail with Brewer Park and Miller Creek on the mountain bike. Brewer was the real stuff! There I 
pushed myself on amazing terrain I've not had the pleasure of enduring before. Tons of slick-rock, drops, climbs, jumps, a brutal set of uphill switchbacks. Black Diamonds in Duluth are serious business, and nowhere was more evident than the torture run through The Kissing Booth segment at Brewer. It pays to push yourself, and I did many things I hadn't considered I could do before, learning a lot of confidence on the bike. On the flip side, there were so many obstacles that I slammed the brakes and walked my way through, including a three foot launch to downhill with a hard left at the end. *Hard pass*. 

Miller Creek was a flow riding dream, but it was largely boring with sparce moments of excitement and speed. Most of the trails in Duluth are bi-directional, which hasn't been a horrible experience, but I had to shut down hard into an endo off of a boardwalk in Miller because just around the corner was another rider. I made for a soft landing, so I was completely fine - though she was hardly convinced of it. At the end of it, there was a spot close to the truck that afforded a beautiful place to set the camp chair and watch the sunset. Somehow the camera had a very hard time capturing it, so I guess it will live most vividly in my mental gallery. Returning to the truck, there were a couple of other guys that layed down the tribal knowledge of the area, and while I didn't ride it wrong exactly, there were much better trails beyond my path. Those will stay in my back pocket for another day.

I took a quick shower at the marina I registered camping in, and went downtown to get a couple beers and a good old taste of Duluth. Oddly enough all three of my beers were Bent Paddle Black IPA because it is goddamn delicious. It was especially well paired with the fresh slice of cheese pizza from the best Pizza Luce on the planet. At 11 o'clock I called it a night and headed to the marina to sleep in the truck. Definitely a fantastic way to spend the day.

7:00am my alarm went off, I got up, snapped a couple pictures of the fog rolling off the still water in the light of the sunrise, and the boats mirrored in the depths. Breakfast. Off to Jay Cooke.

Masochists should try this, because in my infinite wisdom the furthest away overlook must be the most desirable trail and destination. Boy was I wrong. I hiked 3.5 hours straight through forest (no view of water the whole time), to an underwhelming view that didn't even have a picnic table waiting for me. I took a nap on the ground - thankfully the grass was dry. Going back doubled down on the trouble as rain threatened my already soggy feet and worse my camera that did not have a dry bag to hide in. I raced back as best I could despite the burning protest of my feet, to round out 7 hours on the trail. I'm glad to have done it, but I would flat refuse doing it ever again. I'm sore, I'm beat, I've had my ass kicked. Time for that burger, and I'll be back on my way home. 

Until next time.
